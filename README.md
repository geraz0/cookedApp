# cookedApp

Explanation of Each Subdirectory and File:

/client - This folder contains all the code related to the front-end of the application built with React.

/public: Contains static assets like index.html, images, and icons that the React app might use.
/src: Contains the actual React code, including components, pages, and services.
/components: This is where you place reusable React components (e.g., buttons, form elements).
/pages: Full pages of the application that are mapped to specific routes (URLs).
/services: Responsible for handling API requests to the backend.
/styles: Where CSS/SCSS files are stored to style the application.
/utils: Utility functions that may be used across multiple components.
App.js: The main React component, usually where the routes and main structure of the app reside.
index.js: The entry point for the React application; renders the React app.
/server - This folder contains the code for the back-end of the application built using Node.js and Express.

/config: Configuration files for database connections and environment variables.
/controllers: Functions that handle HTTP requests and responses. These work as the middle layer between routes and models.
/models: Defines the structure of data (database models) that the backend uses, especially for MySQL or other databases.
/routes: API endpoints that handle incoming HTTP requests from the front-end.
/middleware: Functions that are executed during the request/response cycle, such as authentication or logging.
/utils: Utility functions or helper modules that assist the back-end logic.
index.js: The entry point of the Express server.
/scripts - Scripts for deployment or other automation processes (optional, but useful for CI/CD pipelines).

/test - Test files for both the client and server code. This is where unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are located.

/assets - Shared assets between the client and server, such as a common logo, icons, or shared media files.

.gitignore - Specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git, such as node_modules or environment variables.

package.json - Manages project dependencies and scripts for both the front-end and back-end. It includes the information for running the project and installing necessary dependencies.

README.md - The documentation of the project where you explain what the project does, how to install and run it, and other important information.

docker-compose.yml - Optional file for containerizing your application using Docker, allowing you to define and run multi-container Docker applications, such as separating the database and server in containers.
